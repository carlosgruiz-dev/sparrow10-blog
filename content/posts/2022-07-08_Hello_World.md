So yes, I started a new blog. Because GitHub pages and Hugo are not a big deal, this was the easy
part. Now, the following steps are another story. Well, my initial idea of having a new blog was
not to stress too much about formatting, preparation, and proofreading, but to write somewhere much
of the information I like to revisit in the future.

I'll not fill this post with promises about things I will not do, and only say, welcome all of you,
and wish me luck. See you in my next post.
