A [/now page][1] is a place where we add information about what are we focused on at this point of
our life. It has been a while since I updated [mine][2], so we go:

## Work

Recently I changed jobs, work now for [Vanguard X][3] as a Python Engineer for [Drakontas][4].
A new experience, updating different GIS modules inside DragonForce, and designing new
capabilities.

## Learning

I enrolled in this [Master in Big Data and Business Analytics][5], and will continue with other
courses on my list.

And making advances on [Scala Exercises][9]

## Reading

Continuing with [The Expanse][10], I'm reading the fourth book [Cibola Burn][11]. And stoics
are present in my reading with [The Obstacle is the Way][12] and [Daily Stoic][13]. Other books I read
not too often are:

- [Akka in Action][14]
