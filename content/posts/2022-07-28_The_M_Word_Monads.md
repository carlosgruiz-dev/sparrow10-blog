When you start with functional programming, saying [the M word][1] is like swearing. This esoteric,
strange, and uncommon word points to a general pattern that takes some time to grasp. Despite
saying that [a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors][2] is accurate, for a newbie is
as unhelpful as [comparing monads with burritos][3]. It just misses the point.

Here are some videos I found valuable for understanding this concept with a practical approach.
