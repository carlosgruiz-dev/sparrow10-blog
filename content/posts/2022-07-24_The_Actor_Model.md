I love this conversation between [Carl Hewitt][1], [Clemens Szyperski][2], and [Erik Meijer][3],
describing the [Actor Model][4]. It is a very interesting concurrency model that use an abstraction
called actor as the fundamental unit of computation (embodying processing, storage, and
communications). I would like to learn more about actors and how to use them with [akka][5].

This is maybe the most famous quote about the Actor Model.

- "One actor is no actor, they come in systems"

See you next time.
