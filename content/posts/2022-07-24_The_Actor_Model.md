I love this conversation between [Carl Hewitt][1], [Clemens Szyperski][2], and [Erik Meijer][3],
describing the [Actor Model][4]. This concurrency model use an abstraction called actor as the
fundamental unit of computation (embodying processing, storage, and communications). It is a very
interesting concurrency model that I would like to learn.

This is maybe the most famous quote about the Actor Model.

- "One actor is no actor, they come in systems"

See you next time.
