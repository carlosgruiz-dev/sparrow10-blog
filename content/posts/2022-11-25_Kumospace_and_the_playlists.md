At [Vanguard X][0] we use [Kumomspace][1] to have a space similar to an actual office floor. It is
a cool space to interact with each other, pack a bunch of people in a small office to chat over a
theme or having virtual refreshments. The healthier coffee I ever had.

Here is a look of my office.

In one of the accessories that has music (on the rooftop area)  I discovered this song and is
really cool to get into a party mood.

And we add the [Lofi Girl][2] for an area for relaxation.

Maybe all of this is not the Metaverse, but it is a lot of fun and warming in a 100% remote job.

See you next time.
