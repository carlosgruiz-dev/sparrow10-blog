Today I was playing with [Scala.js][1] adding a [canvas][2] to an HTML page.
So, there it is, a code generated canvas changing colors randomly.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<iframe src="/code/canvas-scalajs-01/index.html" width="100%" height="400" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

See you in another post.
