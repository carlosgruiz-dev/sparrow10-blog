Here is a quote from [Marcus Aurelius][1] in the book [The Daily Stoic][2] for July 13th. I love
this book, these tiny bits of Stoic wisdom, are a reminder to keep going, live a good life, and do
your duty.

> "One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another
> is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor. A third kind of
> person acts as if not conscious of the deed, rather like a vine producing a cluster of grapes
> without making further demands, like a horse after its race, or a dog after its walk, or a bee
> after making its honey. Such a person, having done a good deed, wonâ€™t go shouting from rooftops
> but simply moves on to the next deed just like the vine produces another bunch of grapes in the
> right season."
>
> _Marcus Aurelius. Meditations, 5.6_
