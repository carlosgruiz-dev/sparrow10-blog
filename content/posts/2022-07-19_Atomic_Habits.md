[Atomic Habits][1] is a book that has become a reference for building good habits. These quotes
talk about putting our effort into the systems that maintain improvements instead of setting goals.

![If you whant better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead][2]

![You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.][3]

When willpower fails, habits could be the difference between achieving or not a permanent change
in our lifestyle. I will comment more about habits in the future.

See you next time.
