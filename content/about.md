Hi there, glad to see you here. My name is Carlos Gustavo. I'm a Venezuelan Systems Engineer living
in Panama since 2016. I work as a developer and have experience with geospatial technologies and
data engineering. You can find more about my profile on my [main website][me].

This blog, as I intended, is more casual and relaxed. Half made ideas, some notes. Maybe a longer
format for my Twitter account. Sure I'll drop techie stuff here but also expect some random stuff.

So yes, I started a new blog again. I hope this one will last more.

By the way, if you find something helpful on this page, please give credit to the authors of the
source material or me if it's something mine.
