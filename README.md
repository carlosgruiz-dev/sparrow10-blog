# [sparrow10.com][2] source code

This blog, as I intended, is casual and relaxed. Half baked ideas, and some notes. Maybe as a longer format for my Twitter account. Sure Iâ€™ll drop techie stuff here but also expect some random stuff. 

From a technical point of view, this is a blog made with [Hugo][3] and the theme [Ink].
