      <description>Here is a quote from Marcus Aurelius in the book The Daily Stoic for July 13th. I love this book, these tiny bits of Stoic wisdom, are a reminder to keep going, live a good life, and do your duty.
 &amp;ldquo;One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor.</description>
