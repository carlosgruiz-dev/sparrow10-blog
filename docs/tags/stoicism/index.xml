      <description>The Obstacle Is the Way is a book that is quick to read, but I’m sure I will revisit it. This quote talks about putting to test our perceptions and first impressions. In a way, to train ourselves to be objectives.
See you next time.</description>

      <description>Here is a quote from Marcus Aurelius in the book The Daily Stoic for July 13th. I love this book, these tiny bits of Stoic wisdom, are a reminder to keep going, live a good life, and do your duty.
 &amp;ldquo;One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor.</description>
