      <description>Today I had more time to try Scala.js again. Now, I added a bit of order to this chaos of random colors, we loop through the different positions of the board.
 See you in another post.</description>

      <description>Today I played a little more with Scala.js, and make some progress on my tic-tac-toe project ðŸ™‚. Now we have a board like an ugly John Travolta&amp;rsquo;s dance floor.

      <description>If you look at yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article, you maybe wonder how it works. Well, the code is very straightforward. We import our dependencies for exporting the function, using the dom, and generating random numbers.

Using a Scala object, we create a method called main and add an annotation to say the Scala.js compiler that we want to expose this function. Inside the function, we create a canvas object, add it to the dom, and adjust its size to fill all the space.</description>

      <description>Today I was playing with Scala.js adding a canvas to an HTML page. So, there it is, a code generated canvas changing colors randomly.
