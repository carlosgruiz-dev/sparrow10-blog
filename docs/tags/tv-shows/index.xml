      <description>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the Game of Thrones TV show, I jumped into the books, and it was a great experience. Not so nerd to be an ASOIF expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.
Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of The Expanse on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure.</description>
