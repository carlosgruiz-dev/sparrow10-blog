      <description>Apache Kafka is a central piece for a lot of data architectures. One of Kafka&amp;rsquo;s key features is velocity, in addition to the publish-subscribe pattern, logs, and more. This video shows what people mean when they say Kafka is fast, and how it is accomplished.</description>

      <description>When you start with functional programming, saying the M word is like swearing. This esoteric, strange, and uncommon word points to a general pattern that takes some time to grasp. Despite saying that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors is accurate, for a newbie is as unhelpful as comparing monads with burritos. It just misses the point.
Here are some videos I found valuable for understanding this concept with a practical approach.</description>

      <title>The Actor Model</title>

      <description>I love this conversation between Carl Hewitt, Clemens Szyperski, and Erik Meijer, describing the Actor Model. It is a very interesting concurrency model that use an abstraction called actor as the fundamental unit of computation (embodying processing, storage, and communications). I would like to learn more about actors and how to use them with akka.
This is maybe the most famous quote about the Actor Model.
 &amp;ldquo;One actor is no actor, they come in systems&amp;rdquo;  See you next time.</description>

      <description>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the Game of Thrones TV show, I jumped into the books, and it was a great experience. Not so nerd to be an ASOIF expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.
Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of The Expanse on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure.</description>
