      <description>I love this conversation between Carl Hewitt, Clemens Szyperski, and Erik Meijer, describing the Actor Model. This concurrency model use an abstraction called actor as the fundamental unit of computation (embodying processing, storage, and communications). It is a very interesting concurrency model that I would like to learn.
This is maybe the most famous quote about the Actor Model.
 &amp;ldquo;One actor is no actor, they come in systems&amp;rdquo;  See you next time.</description>

      <description>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the Game of Thrones TV show, I jumped into the books, and it was a great experience. Not so nerd to be an ASOIF expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.
Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of The Expanse on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure.</description>
