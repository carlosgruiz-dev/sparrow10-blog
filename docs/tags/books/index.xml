      <description>Here is a quote from Marcus Aurelius in the book The Daily Stoic for July 13th. I love this book, these tiny bits of Stoic wisdom, are a reminder to keep going, live a good life, and do your duty.
 &amp;ldquo;One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor.</description>

      <description>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the Game of Thrones TV show, I jumped into the books, and it was a great experience. Not so nerd to be an ASOIF expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.
Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of The Expanse on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure.</description>
