      <description>If you look at yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article, you maybe wonder how it works. Well, the code is very straightforward. We import our dependencies for exporting the function, using the dom, and generating random numbers.

Using a Scala object, we create a method called main and add an annotation to say the Scala.js compiler that we want to expose this function. Inside the function, we create a canvas object, add it to the dom, and adjust its size to fill all the space.</description>

      <description>Today I was playing with Scala.js adding a canvas to an HTML page. So, there it is, a code generated canvas changing colors randomly.

      <title>Starting with Scala.js</title>

      <description>Scala.js is an option for generating JavaScript code using the Scala programming language, with the benefits of a strongly typed system, functional and object-oriented capacities, and a great alternative to share code between the backend and the frontend of a web application. All this sounds great, but the Scala ecosystem is vast, sometimes you end up spending hours looking for what path to start with (I know this because Iâ€™ve done it, and it is crushing).</description>
