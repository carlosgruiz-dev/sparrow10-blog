      <description>I found this answer on StackOverflow that is worth saving and revisiting in the future. Concurrency is a broad topic, having a lot of options and layers of implementation. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s make this a starting point.
OK, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best. There are caveats everywhere, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best to give my understanding of these terms and references to something that approximates the definition I&amp;rsquo;ve given.</description>

      <description>I love this conversation between Carl Hewitt, Clemens Szyperski, and Erik Meijer, describing the Actor Model. It is a very interesting concurrency model that use an abstraction called actor as the fundamental unit of computation (embodying processing, storage, and communications). I would like to learn more about actors and how to use them with akka.
This is maybe the most famous quote about the Actor Model.
&amp;ldquo;One actor is no actor, they come in systems&amp;rdquo; See you next time.</description>
