      <description>If you like functional programming, this is an awesome game you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss. Well, it is cool if you are nerd enough to try to guess the function names from their signatures. It has been some time since I played with Haskell, so scoring 6/6 was a complete surprise.
Try it yourself! ðŸ˜ƒ

Hey there, I scored 6/6 on https://t.co/BO5nF19zTO. Give it a shot! #Haskell via @_andys8</description>

      <description>When you start with functional programming, saying the M word is like swearing. This esoteric, strange, and uncommon word points to a general pattern that takes some time to grasp. Despite saying that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors is accurate, for a newbie is as unhelpful as comparing monads with burritos. It just misses the point.
Here are some videos I found valuable for understanding this concept with a practical approach.</description>
