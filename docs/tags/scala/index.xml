      <description>Today I had more time to try Scala.js again. Now, I added a bit of order to this chaos of random colors, we loop through the different positions of the board.

      <description>Scala.js is a Scala to JavaScript compiler. In this post, we are going to see a couple of ways to start a project. Foremost we need to install sbt and node.js (I prefer to use nvm which allows us to install and use different versions).
One way to start a project in Scala is using a giter8 template. For Scala.js there is no template from official sources, but some were created by third parties.</description>

      <title>The &#34;M&#34; word (Monads)</title>

      <description>When you start with functional programming, saying the M word is like swearing. This esoteric, strange, and uncommon word points to a general pattern that takes some time to grasp. Despite saying that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors is accurate, for a newbie is as unhelpful as comparing monads with burritos. It just misses the point.
Here are some videos I found valuable for understanding this concept with a practical approach.</description>

      <description>Today I played a little more with Scala.js, and make some progress on my tic-tac-toe project ðŸ™‚. Now we have a board like an ugly John Travolta&amp;rsquo;s dance floor.

      <title>Playing with Scala.js and a canvas (code)</title>

      <description>If you look at yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article, you maybe wonder how it works. Well, the code is very straightforward. We import our dependencies for exporting the function, using the dom, and generating random numbers.
Using a Scala object, we create a method called main and add an annotation to say the Scala.js compiler that we want to expose this function. Inside the function, we create a canvas object, add it to the dom, and adjust its size to fill all the space.</description>

      <description>Today I was playing with Scala.js adding a canvas to an HTML page. So, there it is, a code generated canvas changing colors randomly.

      <title>Starting with Scala.js</title>
      <link>https://www.sparrow10.com/posts/2022-07-10_scalajs/</link>

      <description>Scala.js is an option for generating JavaScript code using the Scala programming language, with the benefits of a strongly typed system, functional and object-oriented capacities, and a great alternative to share code between the backend and the frontend of a web application. All this sounds great, but the Scala ecosystem is vast, sometimes you end up spending hours looking for what path to start with (I know this because Iâ€™ve done it, and it is crushing).</description>
