      <description>If you like functional programming, this is an awesome game you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss. Well, it is cool if you are nerd enough to try to guess the function names from their signatures. It has been some time since I played with Haskell, so scoring 6/6 was a complete surprise.
Try it yourself! ðŸ˜ƒ

      <description>Tic-tac-toe is a popular game that everyone has played once. But playing and explaining the game to a computer are different things. So, this article is a kind of explanation for non-programmers about how we reason about automating routines or creating programs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the central part of the game, the board. Our board is a 3x3 table where we place our moves. If we want the computer to understand what is happening on the board, we must identify the possible positions.</description>
