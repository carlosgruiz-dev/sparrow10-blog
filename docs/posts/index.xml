      <title>Tic-Tac-Toe (Part 1)</title>

      <description>Tic-tac-toe is a popular game that everyone has played once. But playing and explaining the game to a computer are different things. So, this article is a kind of explanation for non-programmers about how we reason about automating routines or creating programs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the central part of the game, the board. Our board is a 3x3 table where we place our moves. If we want the computer to understand what is happening on the board, we must identify the possible positions.</description>

      <description>Atomic Habits is a book that has become a reference for building good habits. These quotes talk about putting our effort into the systems that maintain improvements instead of setting goals.
When willpower fails, habits could be the difference between achieving or not a permanent change in our lifestyle. I will comment more about habits in the future.

      <title>Playing with Scala.js and a canvas (code)</title>

      <description>If you look at yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article, you maybe wonder how it works. Well, the code is very straightforward. We import our dependencies for exporting the function, using the dom, and generating random numbers.

Using a Scala object, we create a method called main and add an annotation to say the Scala.js compiler that we want to expose this function. Inside the function, we create a canvas object, add it to the dom, and adjust its size to fill all the space.</description>

      <description>Today I was playing with Scala.js adding a canvas to an HTML page. So, there it is, a code generated canvas changing colors randomly.

      <description>I walk into the living room with my e-book reader in my hand and think aloud: - This is the best investment I have ever made in my life.
My wife looks at me like saying, - What?.
Then I realize she is waiting for an answer: - Marrying you babe, marrying you, is the best investment I have ever made. And having bought this Kindle.</description>

      <description>Here is a quote from Marcus Aurelius in the book The Daily Stoic for July 13th. I love this book, these tiny bits of Stoic wisdom, are a reminder to keep going, live a good life, and do your duty.
 &amp;ldquo;One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor.</description>

      <description>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the Game of Thrones TV show, I jumped into the books, and it was a great experience. Not so nerd to be an ASOIF expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.
Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of The Expanse on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure.</description>

      <title>Starting with Scala.js</title>

      <description>Scala.js is an option for generating JavaScript code using the Scala programming language, with the benefits of a strongly typed system, functional and object-oriented capacities, and a great alternative to share code between the backend and the frontend of a web application. All this sounds great, but the Scala ecosystem is vast, sometimes you end up spending hours looking for what path to start with (I know this because I’ve done it, and it is crushing).</description>

      <description>So yes, I started a new blog. Because GitHub pages and Hugo are not a big deal, this was the easy part. Now, the following steps are another story. Well, my initial idea of having a new blog was not to stress too much about formatting, preparation, and proofreading, but to write somewhere much of the information I like to revisit in the future.
I&amp;rsquo;ll not fill this post with promises about things I will not do, and only say, welcome all of you, and wish me luck.</description>
