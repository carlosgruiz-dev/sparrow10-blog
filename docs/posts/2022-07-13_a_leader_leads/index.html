				<p>Here is a quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Perseverance-translations-ebook/dp/B01KAFIQE6/">The Daily Stoic</a> for July 13th. I love
this book, these tiny bits of Stoic wisdom, are a reminder to keep going, live a good life, and do
your duty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another
is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor. A third kind of
person acts as if not conscious of the deed, rather like a vine producing a cluster of grapes
without making further demands, like a horse after its race, or a dog after its walk, or a bee
after making its honey. Such a person, having done a good deed, won’t go shouting from rooftops
but simply moves on to the next deed just like the vine produces another bunch of grapes in the
right season.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Marcus Aurelius. Meditations, 5.6</em></p>
