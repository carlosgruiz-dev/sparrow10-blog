				<p>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/">Game of Thrones TV show</a>, I jumped into the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074C5QDDK">book</a>, and it was a great experience.
Not so nerd to be an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074C5QDDK">ASOIF</a> expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the
eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.</p>
<p>Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/">The Expanse</a> on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious
to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure. A year later I got a subscription, and finally, I
dive in.</p>
<p>If you want to know what <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/">The Expanse</a> is about, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AltShiftX">AltShiftX</a> video is a great
starting point.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNjrI0YvZYA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Currently, I’m finishing the 3rd book of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DD17H3N">the saga</a> “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQ018I">Abandon’s Gate</a>”. Using the same
Game of Thrones style of character points of view to tell the events, the authors add to the story
an intimate relationship with the characters' feelings and struggles, I love this.</p>
<p>Hoping you find interesting these TV show and books too, see you in another post.</p>
