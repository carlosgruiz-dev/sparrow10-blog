Concurrency is a broad topic, having a lot of options and layers of implementation. Well, let&rsquo;s
make this a starting point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;m going to do my best. There are caveats everywhere, but I&rsquo;m going to do my best to
give my understanding of these terms and references to something that approximates the
definition I&rsquo;ve given.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)">Process</a>: OS-managed (possibly) truly concurrent, at least in the presence of suitable
hardware support. Exist within their own address space.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science)">Thread</a>: OS-managed, within the same address space as the parent and all its other threads.
Possibly truly concurrent, and multi-tasking is pre-emptive.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">Green Thread</a>: These are user-space projections of the same concept as threads, but are
not OS-managed. Probably not truly concurrent, except in the sense that there may be multiple
worker threads or processes giving them CPU time concurrently, so probably best to consider this
as interleaved or multiplexed.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sics.se/~adam/pt/">Protothreads</a>: I couldn&rsquo;t really tease a definition out of these. I think they are
interleaved and program-managed, but don&rsquo;t take my word for it. My sense was that they are
essentially an application-specific implementation of the same kind of &ldquo;green threads&rdquo; model,
with appropriate modification for the application domain.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science)">Fibers</a>: OS-managed. Exactly threads, except co-operatively multitasking, and hence not
truly concurrent.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine">Coroutines</a>: Exactly fibers, except not OS-managed.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.go-program.com/goroutines/">Goroutines</a>: They claim to be unlike anything else, but they seem to be exactly green
threads, as in, process-managed in a single address space and multiplexed onto system threads.
Perhaps somebody with more knowledge of Go can cut through the marketing material.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that there are other understandings in concurrency theory of the term
&ldquo;process&rdquo;, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus">process calculus</a> sense. This definition is orthogonal to those above, but
I just thought it worth mentioning so that no confusion arises should you see process used in
that sense somewhere.</p>
<p>Also, be aware of the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">parallel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)">concurrent</a>. It&rsquo;s possible you
were using the former in your question where I think you meant the latter.</p>
