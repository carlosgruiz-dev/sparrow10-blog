				<p>Hi there, glad to see you here. My name is Carlos Gustavo. I&rsquo;m a Venezuelan Systems Engineer living
in Panama since 2016. I work as a developer and have experience with geospatial technologies and
data engineering. You can find more about my profile on my <a href="https://carlosgustavoruiz.me">main website</a>.</p>
<p>This blog, as I intended, is more casual and relaxed. Half made ideas, some notes. Maybe a longer
format for my Twitter account. Sure I&rsquo;ll drop techie stuff here but also expect some random stuff.</p>
<p>So yes, I started a new blog again. I hope this one will last more.</p>
