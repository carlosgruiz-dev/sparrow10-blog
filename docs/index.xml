      <description>Here is a quote from Marcus Aurelius in the book The Daily Stoic for July 13th. I love this book, these tiny bits of Stoic wisdom, are a reminder to keep going, live a good life, and do your duty.
 &amp;ldquo;One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor.</description>

      <description>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the Game of Thrones TV show, I jumped into the books, and it was a great experience. Not so nerd to be an ASOIF expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.
Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of The Expanse on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure.</description>

      <title>Starting with Scala.js</title>
      <link>https://www.sparrow10.com/posts/2022-07-10_scalajs/</link>

      <description>Scala.js is an option for generating JavaScript code using the Scala programming language, with the benefits of a strongly typed system, functional and object-oriented capacities, and a great alternative to share code between the backend and the frontend of a web application. All this sounds great, but the Scala ecosystem is vast, sometimes you end up spending hours looking for what path to start with (I know this because I’ve done it, and it is crushing).</description>

      <title>Hello, World!</title>

      <description>So yes, I started a new blog. Because GitHub pages and Hugo are not a big deal, this was the easy part. Now, the following steps are another story. Well, my initial idea of having a new blog was not to stress too much about formatting, preparation, and proofreading, but to write somewhere much of the information I like to revisit in the future.
I&amp;rsquo;ll not fill this post with promises about things I will not do, and only say, welcome all of you, and wish me luck.</description>

      <description>Hi there, glad to see you here. My name is Carlos Gustavo. I&amp;rsquo;m a Venezuelan Systems Engineer living in Panama since 2016. I work as a developer and have experience with geospatial technologies and data engineering. You can find more about my profile on my main website.
This blog, as I intended, is more casual and relaxed. Half made ideas, some notes. Maybe a longer format for my Twitter account. Sure I&amp;rsquo;ll drop techie stuff here but also expect some random stuff.</description>
