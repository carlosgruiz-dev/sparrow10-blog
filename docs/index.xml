      <description>So yes, I started a new blog. Because GitHub pages and Hugo are not a big deal, this was the easy part. Now, the following steps are another story. Well, my initial idea of having a new blog was not to stress too much about formatting, preparation, and proofreading, but to write somewhere much of the information I like to revisit in the future.
I&amp;rsquo;ll not fill this post with promises about things I will not do, and only say, welcome all of you, and wish me luck.</description>

      <description>Hi there, glad to see you here. My name is Carlos Gustavo. I&amp;rsquo;m a Venezuelan Systems Engineer living in Panama since 2016. I work as a developer and have experience with geospatial technologies and data engineering. You can find more about my profile on my main website.
This blog, as I intended, is more casual and relaxed. Half made ideas, some notes. Maybe a longer format for my Twitter account. Sure I&amp;rsquo;ll drop techie stuff here but also expect some random stuff.</description>
