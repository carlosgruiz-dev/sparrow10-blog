      <description>I love sparrows. For me, they are like good omen messengers, a call for a simple life, enjoying small things, and living at the moment.
 Look at the sparrows; they do not know what they will do in the next moment. Let us literally live from moment to moment.

 Thanks @cuaimelis for this little guy.</description>

      <description>If you like functional programming, this is an awesome game you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss. Well, it is cool if you are nerd enough to try to guess the function names from their signatures. It has been some time since I played with Haskell, so scoring 6/6 was a complete surprise.
Try it yourself! ðŸ˜ƒ

Hey there, I scored 6/6 on https://t.co/BO5nF19zTO. Give it a shot! #Haskell via @_andys8</description>

      <description>I watched this video some years ago, and it was a fascinating depiction of the early software industry, about how creative people were able to imagine solutions that even today may be considered science fiction. Hope you enjoy this video as I did.

      <title>The &#34;M&#34; word (Monads)</title>

      <guid>https://www.sparrow10.com/posts/2022-07-28_the_m_word_monads/</guid>
      <description>When you start with functional programming, saying the M word is like swearing. This esoteric, strange, and uncommon word points to a general pattern that takes some time to grasp. Despite saying that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors is accurate, for a newbie is as unhelpful as comparing monads with burritos. It just misses the point.
Here are some videos I found valuable for understanding this concept with a practical approach.</description>

      <description>I found this answer on StackOverflow that is worth saving and revisiting in the future. Concurrency is a broad topic, having a lot of options and layers of implementation. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s make this a starting point.
 OK, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best. There are caveats everywhere, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best to give my understanding of these terms and references to something that approximates the definition I&amp;rsquo;ve given.</description>

      <title>The Actor Model</title>

      <description>I love this conversation between Carl Hewitt, Clemens Szyperski, and Erik Meijer, describing the Actor Model. It is a very interesting concurrency model that use an abstraction called actor as the fundamental unit of computation (embodying processing, storage, and communications). I would like to learn more about actors and how to use them with akka.
This is maybe the most famous quote about the Actor Model.
 &amp;ldquo;One actor is no actor, they come in systems&amp;rdquo;  See you next time.</description>

      <description>Tic-tac-toe is a popular game that everyone has played once. But playing and explaining the game to a computer are different things. So, this article is a kind of explanation for non-programmers about how we reason about automating routines or creating programs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the central part of the game, the board. Our board is a 3x3 table where we place our moves. If we want the computer to understand what is happening on the board, we must identify the possible positions.</description>

      <description>Atomic Habits is a book that has become a reference for building good habits. These quotes talk about putting our effort into the systems that maintain improvements instead of setting goals.
When willpower fails, habits could be the difference between achieving or not a permanent change in our lifestyle. I will comment more about habits in the future.

      <description>If you look at yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article, you maybe wonder how it works. Well, the code is very straightforward. We import our dependencies for exporting the function, using the dom, and generating random numbers.

Using a Scala object, we create a method called main and add an annotation to say the Scala.js compiler that we want to expose this function. Inside the function, we create a canvas object, add it to the dom, and adjust its size to fill all the space.</description>

My wife looks at me like saying, - What?.
Then I realize she is waiting for an answer: - Marrying you babe, marrying you, is the best investment I have ever made. And having bought this Kindle.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor.</description>

      <description>Not so long ago, I realized that I became a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. After watching the Game of Thrones TV show, I jumped into the books, and it was a great experience. Not so nerd to be an ASOIF expert, it was for me a new experience to live through the eyes of those characters what was happening in their world.
Sometime later, when I watched a teaser of The Expanse on Amazon Prime Video, it was obvious to me that it will be my next sci-fi adventure.</description>

      <description>Scala.js is an option for generating JavaScript code using the Scala programming language, with the benefits of a strongly typed system, functional and object-oriented capacities, and a great alternative to share code between the backend and the frontend of a web application. All this sounds great, but the Scala ecosystem is vast, sometimes you end up spending hours looking for what path to start with (I know this because Iâ€™ve done it, and it is crushing).</description>

      <description>So yes, I started a new blog. Because GitHub pages and Hugo are not a big deal, this was the easy part. Now, the following steps are another story. Well, my initial idea of having a new blog was not to stress too much about formatting, preparation, and proofreading, but to write somewhere much of the information I like to revisit in the future.
I&amp;rsquo;ll not fill this post with promises about things I will not do, and only say, welcome all of you, and wish me luck.</description>

      <description>Hi there, glad to see you here. My name is Carlos Gustavo. I&amp;rsquo;m a Venezuelan Systems Engineer living in Panama since 2016. I work as a developer and have experience with geospatial technologies and data engineering. You can find more about my profile on my main website.
This blog, as I intended, is more casual and relaxed. Half made ideas, some notes. Maybe a longer format for my Twitter account. Sure I&amp;rsquo;ll drop techie stuff here but also expect some random stuff.</description>
